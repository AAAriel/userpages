   * - 【狼狗】

     - Jackal

   * - 有一次，佛陀在他停留的森林中看見一隻狼狗跑出來，它站了一侍兒，然後跑進草叢，又跑了出來，隨後衝進一個樹洞裡，又再衝了出來。一下子跑進穴裡又再跑出來。站了一分鐘，又開始跑了起來，接著又躺、又跳，原來那隻狼狗生了疥癬。當它站著的時候，疥癬會侵入它的皮膚，所以痛得拚命跑。跑時仍覺得不舒服，所以停了下來。站著也不舒服，所以躺了下來，一會兒跳起來，衝進草叢裡，樹洞中，就是無法安定下來。

     - The Buddha and his disciples once saw a jackal run out of the forest they were staying in. It stood still for a while, then it ran into the underbrush, and then out again. Then it ran into a tree hollow, then out again. One minute it stood, the next it ran, then it lay down, then it jumped up. The jackal had the mange. When it stood, the mange would eat into its skin, so it would run. Running, it was still uncomfortable, so it would stop. Standing, it was still uncomfortable, so it would lie down. Then it would jump up again, running to the underbrush, the tree hollow, never staying still.

   * - 佛陀說：「比丘們，今天下午你們有沒有看見那隻狼狗？站著苦，跑也苦；坐下來苦，躺下來也苦；它怪是站著使它不舒服，又說坐不好，跑不好，躺也不好。它怪樹、樹叢、洞穴都不好。事實上問題跟這都無關，，而是在它身上的疥癬。」

     - The Buddha said, "Monks, did you see that jackal this afternoon? Standing, it suffered. Lying down, it suffered. It blamed standing for its discomfort. It blamed sitting. It blamed running and lying down. It blamed the tree, the underbrush, and the cave. In fact, the problem was with none of those things. The problem was with his mange."

   * - 我們就跟那隻狼狗一樣。我們的不快樂由於錯誤的知見。因為我們不自我約制感官，因此責怪外界帶給我們苦痛。無論我們住在泰國、美國或英國，我們都不滿足。為什麼呢？因為我們的知見還不正確，只是如此罷了！所以無論我們走到哪兒，都會不快樂。如同那隻狼狗，無論它走到哪裡，只要疥癬治好後，才會感到輕鬆愉快。因此，當我們除去我們的不正見時，不管走到哪兒，都會很快樂。

     - We are just the same as the jackal. Our discontent is due to wrong view. Because we don't exercise sense restraint, we blame our suffering on externals. Whether we live in Thailand, America or England, we aren't satisfied. Why not? Because we still have wrong view. Just that! So wherever we go, we aren't content. But just as that jackal would be content wherever it went as soon as its mange was cured, so would we be content wherever we went once we cured ourselves of wrong view.
