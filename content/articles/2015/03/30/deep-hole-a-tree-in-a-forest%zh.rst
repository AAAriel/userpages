   * - 【深洞】

     - Deep Hole

   * - 大多數人想行善只是為了功德，但是他們卻不願捨棄惡行，這就叫做「洞太深了」。

     - Most people just want to perform good deeds to make merit, but they don't want to give up wrongdoing. It's just that "the hole is too deep."

   * - 假設有一個洞，洞下面有東西，現在，只要有人將他的手伸進洞裡卻摸不著底面的話，他就會說：「洞太深了。」如果有百或千個人將他們的手伸進洞裡，他們也同樣會說：「這個洞太深了。」可是，卻沒人會說是自己的手太短了！我們必須回到自己身上，退一步反觀自己，不要埋怨是洞太深，而應該回過頭來看看你自己的手臂。如果你可以看透這點，那麼，在你的性靈道上便能更上一層樓，進而尋找到快樂。

     - Suppose there was a hole and there was something at the bottom of it. Now anyone who put his hand into the hole and didn't reach the bottom would say the hole was too deep. If a hundred or a thousand people put their hands down the hole, they'd all say, "The hole is too deep!" No one would say that his arm was too short. We have to come back to ourselves. We have to take a step back and look at ourselves. Don't blame the hole for being too deep. Turn around and look at your own arm. If you can see this, then you will make progress on the spiritual path and will find happiness.
