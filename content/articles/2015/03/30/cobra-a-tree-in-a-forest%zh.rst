   * - 【眼鏡蛇】

     - Cobra

   * - 心理的活動就像能致人於死的眼鏡蛇。假如我們不去打擾一條眼鏡蛇，它自然會走它的；即使它非常毒，我們也不會受到它的影響；只要我們不走近它或去捉它，它就不會來咬我們。眼鏡蛇會照著它的本性行動，事情就是如此！如果你聰明的話，就別去惹它。同樣地，就讓那些不好的和好的順其自然——依它的本性而隨它去不要執著喜歡和不喜歡，如同你不會去打擾眼鏡蛇一樣。

     - Mental activity is like a deadly, poisonous cobra. If we don't interfere with a cobra, it simply goes its own way. Even though it may be extremely poisonous, we are not affected by it. We don't go near it, or take hold of it, and so it doesn't bite us. The cobra does what is natural for a cobra to do. That's the way it is. If you are clever, you'll leave it alone. Likewise, you let be that which is not good - you let it be according to its own nature. You also let be that which is good. Don't grab at liking and disliking, just as you wouldn't grab at the cobra.

   * - 一個聰明的人，將會以這種態度來對待在他心中升起的種種情緒。當善的情緒在心中生起時，讓它自是善的，並且瞭解它的本然；同樣地，我們也讓惡的自是惡的，讓它順其自然。不要執著，因為我們什麼都不要！我們不要惡，也不要善；我們不要負擔和輕鬆，乃至不求快樂和痛苦。當我們的欲求止息時，平靜便穩固地建立起來了。

     - One who is clever will have this kind of attitude towards the various moods that arise in his mind. When goodness arises, we let it be good. We understand its nature. In the same, we let be the non-good. We let it be according to its nature. We don't take hold of it because we don't want anything. We don't want evil. We don't want good. We don't want heaviness or lightness, happiness or suffering. When our wanting is at an end, peace is firmly established.
