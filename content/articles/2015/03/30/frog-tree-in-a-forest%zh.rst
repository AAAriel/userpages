   * - 【青蛙】

     - Frog

   * - 越忽視修行，你會越忽略要到寺院裡來聽聞佛法，而你的心越會深陷沼澤中，如同一隻跳進洞裡的青蛙。只要有人帶著釣鉤過來，這只青蛙的命就不保了，它毫無選擇的餘地，最後只好坐以待斃。小心！可別讓自己也掉進洞裡了，那時候，可能會有人帶著釣鉤把你給釣起來。

     - The more you neglect the practice, and the more you neglect going to the monastery to listen to the Teachings, the more your mind will sink down into a bog, like a frog going into a hole. Later when someone comes along with a hook, the frog's days are over. He doesn't have a chance. All he can do is stretch out his neck and be caught. So watch out you don't back yourself up into a hole. Someone may just come along with a hook and pull you up.

   * - 在家裡，你常被孩子、孫子以及財產煩擾著，這比一隻青蛙還糟！你仍不懂得該如何去舍離它們。一旦要面臨老、病、死的時候，你要怎麼辦呢？這便是那根來釣你的釣鉤，你能往哪裡跑呢？

     - At home, being pestered by your children and grandchildren, and possessions, you are even worse off than the frog! You don't know how to detach yourself from them. When old age, sickness and death come along, what will you do? This is the hook that's going to catch you. Which way will you turn?
