   * - 【結】

     - Knot

   * - 我們必須觀照快樂和不快樂都是不穩固而無常的，也必須瞭解所有的感覺都是不長久、不能執著的。我們這樣來瞭解事物，因為我們有智慧。我們應瞭解事物會如此都是順其本然的。

     - We contemplate happiness and unhappiness as uncertain and impermanent and understand that all the various feelings we experience are not lasting and not to be clung to. We see things in this way, because we have wisdom. We understand that things are impermanent according to their own nature.

   * - 假使我們有這種見解，就猶如手執繩結的一端，只要能把這一端向正確方向拉，結自然會鬆弛而解開來，於是就不會再那麼緊了。

     - If we have this kind of understanding, it's like taking hold of one strand of a rope that makes a knot and pulling it in the right direction. The knot will then loosen and begin to untangle. It'll no longer be so tight and tense.

   * - 這跟明白萬事萬物並不是一成不變的道理很相近。在這之前，我們認為一切事物都必須如何，就因為如此，繩結只有被愈拉愈緊。這種緊，便是痛苦。這樣的生活是非常緊張的，所以，我們要把結鬆掉一些，而且放輕鬆。為甚麼要放鬆呢？就是因為太緊了。如果我們不執著就可以放鬆了，它並不是一個永遠一成不變的狀態。

     - This is similar to understanding that things don't always have to be the way they've always been. Before, we felt that things had to be a certain way, and in so doing, we pulled the knot tighter and tighter. This tightness is suffering. Living that way is very tense. So we loosen the knot a little and relax. Why do we loosen it? Because it's tight! If we don't cling to it, then we can loosen it. It's not a condition that must always be that way.

   * - 我們以無常的教導為基礎，明白快樂與不快樂均非恆常，兩者都不能依靠，也絕無恆常的事物。有了這種認識，我們逐漸會不再信賴錯誤的知見，錯誤的知見就會相對地減少，這便是解結的含義，這樣做，結就會愈來愈松，執著也會隨之逐漸根除。

     - We use the teaching of impermanence as our basis. We see that both happiness and unhappiness are not permanent. We see them as not dependable. There's absolutely nothing that is permanent. With this kind of understanding, we gradually stop believing in the various moods and feelings that come up in our mind. Wrong understanding will decrease in the same degree that we stop believing in them. This is what is meant by undoing the knot. It continues to become looser. Attachment will be gradually uprooted.
