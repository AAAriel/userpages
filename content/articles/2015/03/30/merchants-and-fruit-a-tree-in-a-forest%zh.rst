   * - 【商人】

     - Merchants

   * - 你做每一件事情，你都必須很清楚、很明白。當你看清楚時，就不再需要忍耐或勉強你自己了。你有障礙與負擔，是因為你沒有認清這點。平和是來自一心一意地投入於工作中，沒有完成的工作，會帶給你不滿足的感覺，無論你走到哪兒，都會羈絆著你，使你擔憂牽掛。但你想要完成每一件事，那是不可能的。

     - Everything that you do you must do with clarity and awareness. When you see clearly, you'll no longer feel the need to force yourself to do and complete everything. Now you are burdened with difficulties because you miss the point: whatever you do, you should just do with your body and mind completely. This will bring you peace. If you think you have to do and complete everything, then whenever you leave something undone or incomplete, you'll feel discontented and never stop worrying about it. You want to complete everything, but it's really impossible to do so.

   * - 就拿時常來看我的那些生意人為例，他們說：「當我的債務通通還清，財產也理清時，我就來出家。」話雖這麼說，但他們何時才會結束而準備就緒？永無止期啊！他們用另一個借款來償還債務，還清了一個又借一個。每位生意人都會想，如果能讓他從債務中脫身，他就快樂了，然而還清債務是遙遙無期的。這就是世間愚弄我們的方法。我們就這樣反覆地周旋著，永遠不知道自己的可悲。

     - Take the case of the merchants who regularly come here to see me. They say, "Oh, when my debts are all paid and property in order, I'll come to get ordained." They talk like that, but will they ever finish and get it all in order? There's no end to it. They pay off their debts with another loan; they pay off that one, and do it again. A merchant thinks that when he gets rid of all of his debts, he will be happy, but there's no end to paying things off. That's the way worldliness fools us. We go around and around like that never realizing our predicament.
