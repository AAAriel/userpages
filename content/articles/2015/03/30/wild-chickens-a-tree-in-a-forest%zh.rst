   * - 【野雞】

     - Wild Chickens

   * - 只要真實的智慧還沒顯發出來，我們會一直把感官和它們所接觸的外境視為敵人；一旦真實的智慧現起，無論如何，我們就不再視它們為敵人了，反而成為引領我們進入內觀和清明知見的門戶。

     - As long as true wisdom hasn't yet arisen, we still see the senses and their objects as our enemies. But once true wisdom arises we no longer see them as such. They become the doorway to insight and clear understanding.

   * - 最好的例子就是住在森林裡的野雞。我們都知道，牠們非常懼怕人類。自從我在森林裡居住以來，我在教導牠們的同時，也從牠們身上學習到很多東西。剛開始我撒一些米給牠們吃，起初牠們很害怕，所以不敢接近米，但不久之後，牠們漸漸習慣了，而且也開始期待。牠們原先以為米是危險的敵人。事實上，米並沒有危險性，因為牠們並不瞭解米是食物，所以會害怕。當牠們最後知道沒有什麼好懼怕之後，便毫無顧慮的吃起來了。野雞是在這種方式下很自然地學習。

     - A good example is the wild chickens in the forest. We all know how much they fear humans. Yet since I've lived in the forest, I've been able to teach them and learn from them too. I began by throwing them rice to eat. At first they were afraid and wouldn't go near the rice. But after a while they got used to it and even began to expect it. They first thought the rice was a dangerous enemy. But there was no danger in the rice. They just didn't know the rice was food, so they were afraid. When they finally saw there was nothing to fear, they could come and eat peacefully. Wild chickens learn naturally like this.

   * - 住在森林裡，我們也要以同樣的方式來學習。以前我們認為我們的感官是問題所在，因為我們還無知於如何正確地利用它們，於是給我們造成許多麻煩。但是藉由修行的經驗，我們學習如實地了知它們。我們學習如何利用感官，正如野雞吃米一樣。那麼，感官就不會再與我們作對，問題自然也就沒有了。

     - Living here in the forest, we learn in the same way. Before, we thought our senses were a problem, and because we thought our senses were a problem, and because we didn't know how to use them properly, they were troublesome. Through experience in practice, however, we learn to se them according to the Truth. We learn to use them, just as the chickens did with the rice. Then they're no longer against us and problems disappear.
