   * - 【魚籠】

     - Fish Trap

   * - 如果你清楚地看到了事物的利害關係，就不須等到他人來告訴你。回想一下一位在他魚籠裡找到東西的漁夫的故事。他知道有東西在裡面，也聽到它在魚籠裡面拍動。他認為是一隻魚，於是便將手伸進魚籠裡，竟發現是另一類生物。他看不見所以無法確定到底是什麼。可能是修鰻，不過也有可能是條蛇。如果將它扔掉，他也許會後悔……，如果是條鰻，就可以成為晚餐的佳餚。從另外一方面來看，如果他持續不放，最後竟發覺是條蛇，它可能就會咬他，不過不敢確定。但是，他的慾望卻強烈到不肯放手，只因為那可能就是條鰻。在他抓出的那一刻，霎時見到是條蛇時，不論如何，都會毫不遲疑地馬上扔開它，而不須等到他人喊：「嘿，那是條蛇趕快扔了它！」親睹蛇時比聽人家的警告更清楚地告訴他應該怎麼做。為什麼呢？因為他認識危險——蛇會咬你，並且會導致你死亡。這還需要有人告訴他嗎？同樣的道理，如果我們修行直到我們見到事物的本來面目，我們就不會去幹預對自己有害的事物了。

     - If you see clearly the harm in the benefit of something, you won't have to wait for others to tell you about it. Consider the story of the fisherman who finds something in his fish trap. He knows something is in it because he can hear it flopping about inside. Thinking it's a fish; he reaches his hand into the trap, only to grab hold of a different kind of animal. He can't see it, so he's not sure what it is. It could be an eel, but it could also be a snake. If he throws it away, he may regret it, for if it turns out to be in eel, he'll have lost something nice for dinner. On the other hand, if he keeps on holding onto it and it turns out to be a snake, it may bite him. He's just not sure. But his desire is so strong that he holds on, just in case it's an eel. The minute he brings it out and sees that it's a snake, however, he doesn't hesitate to fling it away from himself. He doesn't have to wait for someone to call out, "Hey, it's a snake! Let go!" The site of the snake tells him what to do more clearly than words could ever do. Why? Because he sees the danger - snakes can bite and make you very sick or kill you. Who has to tell him about that? In the same way, if we practice until we see things as they are, we won't meddle with things that are harmful.
