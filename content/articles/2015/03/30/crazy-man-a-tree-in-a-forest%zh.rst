   * - 【瘋子】

     - Crazy Man

   * - 假設一日清晨，你正走在路上要去工作，有個人無禮地向你叫喊辱罵，霎時，你一聽到這辱罵聲，正常的心便立刻轉變了，你覺得很不舒服，覺得很憤怒和受辱，所以你想要報復。

     - Suppose one morning, you're walking to work and a man starts yelling insults at you. As soon as you hear his insults, your mind gets agitated. You don't feel so good, you feel angry and hurt, and you want to get even!

   * - 幾天以後，另一個人來你家拜訪，並且告訴你：「嘿，那幾天辱罵你的那個人，他瘋了！而且已經好幾年了！他都是這樣辱罵每個人，但是沒有人會去在意他說的話。」當你聽到這兒，霎時，自在了起來。那以往積鬱在你身上數日的憤怒和不快，完全地消失了，為什麼呢？因為現在你已知道事情的真相。以前你還不知道時，認為那個人是正常的，所以你會憎恨他，同時也導致你痛苦。一旦真相大白，事過境遷：「噢，他是個瘋子！事情原來如此。」

     - A few days later, another man comes to your house and tells you, "Hey, that man who abused you the other day, he’s crazy! Has been for years! He abuses everybody like that. Nobody takes notice of anything that he says." As soon as you hear this, you are suddenly relieved. That anger and hurt that you've pent up within you all these days melt away completely. Why? Because now you know the truth. Before, you didn't. You thought that man was normal, so you were angry at him and that caused you to suffer. As soon as you found out the truth, however, everything changed: "Oh, he's mad! That explains everything!"

   * - 當你瞭解到這點時，你覺得很舒服，因為你已親身體驗。瞭解了以後，你就能放下。假如你不明白真相，就會去執著。當你認為那位辱罵你的人是正常時，你可能會殺了他，但當你發現事情的真相——他精神失常，你便覺得舒服多了。這就是瞭解真理。

     - When you understand the truth, you feel fine because you know for yourself. Understanding, you can then let go. If you don't know the truth, you cling right there. When you thought that the man who abused you was normal, for example, you could have killed him. But when you found out the truth, that he was mad, you felt much better. This is knowledge of the truth.

   * - 一個見法的人也有類似的經驗。貪、嗔、痴的消失，是以同樣的方式消失的。當我們不了知這三毒時，我們會認為：「我能夠怎樣呢？我的貪和嗔是如此熾盛。」這並不是清明的認知，跟以為那瘋子是神智健全其實是一樣。只有當我們最後知道他精神失常時，我們的焦慮才得以釋懷。沒有任何人能告知你這些，唯有當心親自體認時，它才能絕滅和捨棄執著。

     - Someone who sees the Dhamma has a similar experience. When attachment, aversion and delusion disappear, they disappear in the same way. As long as we don't know these things, we think, "What can I do? I have so much greed and aversion." This is not clear knowledge. It's just the same as when we thought the madman was sane. Until we learned that he was really otherwise, we weren't able to let go of our hurt and anger. Only when the mind sees for itself, can it uproot and relinquish attachment.
