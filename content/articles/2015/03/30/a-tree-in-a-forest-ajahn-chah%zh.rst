   * - 森林裡的一棵樹

     - A Tree in a Forest

   * - 阿姜 查

     - Venerable Ajahn Chah

   * - 序言

     - Introduction

   * - 阿姜查提醒我們佛陀只能指出修行的道路，卻不能替我們修行，因為真理是不能用語言文字來說明與奉送的。阿姜查教導：「所有的教導只不過是譬喻，用來幫助心靈看到真理，如果在心裡建立起佛陀，那麼我們就可以看到一切事物，視一切事物與我們並沒有什麼差異。」

     - Ajahn Chah himself reminded us that the Buddha himself could only point out the way and could not do the practice for us, because the truth is something that cannot be put into words or given away. "All the teachings" Ajahn Chah taught, "are merely similes and comparisons, means to help the mind see the truth. If we establish the Buddha within our mind, then we see everything, we contemplate everything, as no different from ourselves.

   * - 許多阿姜查自己用來教導的譬喻來自於他廣泛的森林生活經驗。他的修行就是注視，同時完全地敞開心胸，覺察所有發生於自己身心內外的一切。他曾說，他的修行並無特殊之處，套一句他說的話，他像森林裡的一棵樹。「樹只是樹。」他曾這麼說；而阿姜查就只是阿姜查。然而從這「並無特殊之處」中卻產生了對他自己以及世界的深刻瞭解。

     - Many of the similes that Ajahn Chah himself used to teach came out of his vast experience of living in the forest. His practice was simply to watch, all the while being totally open and aware of everything that was happening both inside and outside himself. He would say that his practice was nothing special. He was, in his own words, like a tree in a forest, "A tree is as it is," he's say. And Ajahn Chah was as he was. But out of such "nothing specialness" came a profound understanding of himself and the world.

   * - 阿姜查經常說：「在任何時刻，佛法一直在示現著，但只有在心靈寧靜的時候，我們才能瞭解佛法所教導的，因為佛法不用語言文字教導。」阿姜查有這種奇異而神秘的能力能接受此非語言文字之法，而用一種新鮮易解，時而幽默、時而詩意盎然的譬喻形式，來把這種真理傳播給他的聽眾，而且總能敲中最易受感動的心靈深處：「我們好像蛆一樣啊！生命宛如落葉，心如雨水。」

     - Ajahn Chah used to say, "The Dhamma is revealing itself in every moment, but only when the mind is quiet can we understand what it is saying, for the Dhamma teaches without words." Ajahn Chah had this uncanny ability to take that wordless Dhamma and convey its truth to his listeners in the form of a simile that was fresh, easy to follow, sometimes humorous, sometimes poetic, but always striking a place in the heart where it would jar or inspire the most: "We are like maggots; life is like a falling leaf; our mind is like rain water."

   * - 阿姜查的教導充滿了像這種譬喻及比喻。我們以為把它們蒐集成冊當成一種靈感的泉源會是一個好點子，對那些想中止世間熱惱的人們，他們可以從「森林裡的一棵樹」下的清涼、茂盛的樹陰中得到一些休息。

     - The teachings of Ajahn Chah teem with similes and comparisons like these. We thought it would be a good idea to collect them all in the form of a book as a source of inspiration for those who may want some respite from the "heat" of the world and seek some rest in the cool and abundant shade of "a tree in the forest".

   * - 第一部分

     - Part 1

   * - 我們必須藉由譬喻來談佛法，因為佛法沒有一定的形式。它是方的還是圓的？你說不來。唯一的方法就是透過這些譬喻來說明。

     - "We have to talk about the Dhamma like this, using similes, because the Dhamma has no form. Is it square or is it round? You can't say. The only way to talk about it is through similes like these."

流浪漢 Aimless Wanderer
+++++++++++++++++++++++

   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【流浪漢】

     - Aimless Wanderer

   * - 當我們失去了真正的歸宿時，就像一個沒有目標的流浪漢，流落在街頭。這邊走走，那邊晃晃，一回兒落了腳又得流浪他方。在我們回到真正的家之前，無論如何，都會覺得不舒服，就如同一個離鄉背景的旅人。只有當他再次回到家時，才能真正輕鬆自在。

     - When we have no real home, we're like an aimless wanderer out on the road, going this way for a while and then that way, stopping for a while and then setting off again. Until we return to our real home, whatever we do we feel ill at ease, just like somebody who's left his village to go on a journey. Only when he gets home again can he really relax and be comfortable.

   * - 在這世上我們找不到真正平靜的地方，這是世間的本然。就以觀照你自己的內心代替向外的追求吧！平靜是在你心中找到的。

     - Nowhere in the world is any real peace to be found. That's the nature of the world. Look within yourself and find it there instead.

   * - 當我們憶念起偉大的佛陀，他所說的是那麼真實，我們感到他是多麼值得尊敬啊！當我們看到事物的真相時，即使我們從來沒有真正地去實踐過佛法，也仍看得到他教導的法。然而，就算我們擁有佛法的知識，而且曾學習和實踐佛法，卻仍見不到真理，那麼我們依舊像流浪漢一樣，無家可歸。

     - When we think of the Buddha and how truly he spoke, we feel how worthy he is of reverence and respect. Whenever we see the truth of something, we see his teachings, even if we've never actually practiced Dhamma. But even if we have knowledge of his teachings, have studied and practiced them but still have not seen their truth, then we're still homeless like the aimless wanderer.

盲人 Blind Man
++++++++++++++

.. list-table:: 盲人 Blind Man [3]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【盲人】

     - Blind Man

   * - 身和心不停地在生生滅滅，「行」一直處於遷變的狀態中。我們無法如實地透徹這一點，是因為我們仍頑固地深信虛妄不實的事物。好像一位盲人帶路，我們跟他一起旅行怎麼安全呢？他只會引導我們走入密叢和森林之中，看不見的他，怎麼能帶我們走到安全的地方？同樣的道理，我們的心被「行」所矇蔽，以至於在尋求快樂時造作苦：在尋求平靜時造作了困難。我們真的想要解除痛苦與困難，但相反地，我們卻去造作這些，然後只會抱怨而已。我們會造惡因的原因是因為我們對外觀的真相和「行」的真相毫無認識，而且還一再地去執取它們。

     - Both the body and mind are constantly arising and ceasing, conditions are in a state of constant turmoil. The reason we can't see this in line with the truth is because we keep believing in the untrue. It's like being guided by a blind man. How can we travel with him in safety? A blind man will only lead us into forests and thickets. How could he lead us to safety when he can't see? In the same way, our mind is deluded by conditions, creating suffering in the search for happiness, creating difficulty in the search for peace. Such a mind can have only problems and suffering. Really, we want to get rid of suffering and difficulty, but instead we create those very things. All we can do is complain. We create bad causes, and the truth of appearances and conditions and try to cling to them.

一瓶藥 Bottle of Medicine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. list-table:: 一瓶藥 Bottle of Medicine [4]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【一瓶藥】

     - Bottle of Medicine

   * - 我們可以將修行比喻為一瓶醫生留給病人的藥。瓶上寫了詳細的說明，指示病人如何服藥，但是，如果這位病人只是閱讀瓶上的說明，無論讀上數百回，都將困死在這兒，永遠得不到藥物的治療。在他死亡之前，還會懷恨地埋怨醫生無能，以及那些藥物並沒有治好他。他會認為醫生是個江湖郎中，或說那些藥物毫無作用，殊不知他只是花時間在檢查瓶子以及閱讀瓶上的說明書，卻沒有聽從醫生的叮嚀而服藥。不管怎麼樣，如果這位病人聽從了醫生的勸囑，照著藥方按時服藥，他便能夠痊癒。

     - We can compare practice to a patient who does not take the medicine that his doctor has left for him. Although detailed instructions have been written on the bottle, all the patient does is read them and doesn't actually take the medicine. And before he dies, he may complain bitterly that the doctor wasn't any good; that the medicine didn't cure him. He may think that the doctor was a fake or that the medicine was worthless, yet he had only spent his time examining the bottle and reading its instructions instead of actually taking the medicine. If he had followed the doctor's advice, however, and taken the medicine regularly as prescribed, he would have recovered.

   * - 醫生開藥方是為了除去生理上的疾病；佛陀的教法則是治療心理疾病的藥方，使心回覆到自然健康的狀態。因此，佛陀可稱是一位治療心理疾病的醫生，而我們每一個人毫無例外的都有心理的疾病。當你看到這些疾病時，難道不會合理地去尋求佛法做為依靠，就如同拿藥治療你看書的病一般嗎？

     - Doctors prescribe medicine to eliminate diseases from the body. The teachings of the Buddha are prescribed to cure diseases of the mind and to bring it back to its natural healthy state. So the Buddha can be considered to be a doctor who prescribes cures for the illnesses of the mind, which are found in each one of us without exception. When you see these illnesses of the mind, does it not make sense to look to the Dhamma as support, as medicine to cure your illnesses?

嬉戲的孩子 Child Playing

   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【嬉戲的孩子】

     - Child Playing

   * - 我們對心性反覆地思惟之後，將會瞭解，心就只是心，不會有別的了。我們會明白，心就是心，這是它的本然。如果我們清楚地看清這一點，我們就不會去執著念頭和感覺，只要持續不斷地告訴自己：「它就是如此」，我們就不必要再加些什麼了。當這顆心如實地瞭解，它就能放下一切。雖然仍會有念頭和感覺，但是，每一個念頭和感覺都將失去作用。

     - When we have contemplated the nature of the heart many times, we will come to understand that the heart's ways are just as they are and can't be otherwise. They make up the nature of the heart. If we see this clearly, then we can detach from thoughts and feelings. And we don't have to add on anything more if we constantly tell ourselves that "that's just the way it is." When the heart truly understands, it lets go of everything. Thinking and feeling will be deprived of power.

   * - 就像剛開始被一個喜歡玩卻會干擾我們的小孩煩擾得很厲害，所以我們責打他，但是，事後我們逐漸明白活潑好動是小孩子的天性，於是我們會任他去玩。我們放下了，我們的煩惱也就消失了。為什麼煩惱會消失呢？因為，現在我們已經接受了孩子的天性，看法也已經改變了，而且已經接受事物的真實面目。我們放下，然後心將會變得更平靜。現在，我們已經有了正見。

     - It is like at first being annoyed by a child who likes to play in ways that annoy us so much we scold or spank him. But later we understand that it's natural for a child to play and act like that, so we leave him alone. We let go and our troubles are over. Why are they over? Because we now accept the natural ways of children. Our outlook has changed and we now accept the true nature of things. We let go and our heart becomes more peaceful. We now have right understanding.

眼鏡蛇 Cobra

.. list-table:: 眼鏡蛇 Cobra [6]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【眼鏡蛇】

     - Cobra

   * - 心理的活動就像能致人於死的眼鏡蛇。假如我們不去打擾一條眼鏡蛇，它自然會走它的；即使它非常毒，我們也不會受到它的影響；只要我們不走近它或去捉它，它就不會來咬我們。眼鏡蛇會照著它的本性行動，事情就是如此！如果你聰明的話，就別去惹它。同樣地，就讓那些不好的和好的順其自然——依它的本性而隨它去不要執著喜歡和不喜歡，如同你不會去打擾眼鏡蛇一樣。

     - Mental activity is like a deadly, poisonous cobra. If we don't interfere with a cobra, it simply goes its own way. Even though it may be extremely poisonous, we are not affected by it. We don't go near it, or take hold of it, and so it doesn't bite us. The cobra does what is natural for a cobra to do. That's the way it is. If you are clever, you'll leave it alone. Likewise, you let be that which is not good - you let it be according to its own nature. You also let be that which is good. Don't grab at liking and disliking, just as you wouldn't grab at the cobra.

   * - 一個聰明的人，將會以這種態度來對待在他心中升起的種種情緒。當善的情緒在心中生起時，讓它自是善的，並且瞭解它的本然；同樣地，我們也讓惡的自是惡的，讓它順其自然。不要執著，因為我們什麼都不要！我們不要惡，也不要善；我們不要負擔和輕鬆，乃至不求快樂和痛苦。當我們的欲求止息時，平靜便穩固地建立起來了。

     - One who is clever will have this kind of attitude towards the various moods that arise in his mind. When goodness arises, we let it be good. We understand its nature. In the same, we let be the non-good. We let it be according to its nature. We don't take hold of it because we don't want anything. We don't want evil. We don't want good. We don't want heaviness or lightness, happiness or suffering. When our wanting is at an end, peace is firmly established.

椰子殼 Coconut Shells
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. list-table:: 椰子殼 Coconut Shells [7]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【椰子殼】

     - Coconut Shells

   * - 欲是染著的，但首先我們必須有欲才能開始修行「道」。假設你到市場去買椰子，提著它們回來時，路上，有人問你：「你為什麼要買這些椰子呢？」

     - Desire is a defilement. But we must first have desire in order to start practicing the Way. Suppose you went to buy coconuts at the market and while carrying them back home someone asked: "Why did you buy those coconuts?"

   * - 「買來吃啊！」

     - "I bought them to eat," you reply.

   * - 「你連殼也吃嗎？」

     - "Are you going to eat the shells, too?"

   * - 「當然不！」

     - "Of course not!"

   * - 「我不相信。如果你不打算吃殼，又為什麼要買椰子呢？」

     - "I don't believe you," he insists. "If you're not going to eat the shells, then why did you buy them?"

   * - 好，你怎麼說？你要怎樣回答這個問題？

     - Well, what do you say? How are you going to answer that question?

   * - 我們是靠著慾望起修的，如果我們沒有慾望，我們就不會去修行。你知道嗎？！這樣思惟可以產生智慧。例如：那些椰子，你要連殼子也一起吃下去嗎？當然不！那又為什麼要椰子殼呢？因為椰子殼的用途是將椰子給包起來，吃了過後，再將殼給扔掉，就沒問題了。

     - We practice with desire to begin with. If we didn't have desire, we wouldn't practice. Contemplating in this way can give rise to wisdom, you know. For example, those coconuts: Are you going to eat the shells as well? Of course not. Then why do you take them? They're useful for wrapping the coconuts in. If after eating the coconuts you throw the shells away, there is no problem.

   * - 我們的修行也是如此。我們不是要吃殼，只不過現在還不是丟掉殼的時候。我們先將它們收藏起來，就如我們依靠慾望修行一樣，修行便是如此。如果有人硬要說我們連椰子殼也吃，那是他們的事，與我們無關，只要我們清楚自己在做什麼就夠了。

     - Our practice is the same. We keep desire first, just like we do with the coconut shells, for it's still not time to "throw" it away. This is how the practice is. If somebody wants to accuse us of eating coconut shells, that's their business. We know what we're doing.

烹飪 Cooking

   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【烹飪】

     - Cooking

   * - 首先我們要訓練我們的身和口遠離穢惡，這就是功德。有些人認為要有功德必須整天整夜地背誦巴利文的經句，但事實上，只要使你的身、口清爭無瑕疵，就是功德了。這並不難解，就像在烹調食物，我們放一點點這個，放一點點那個，直到恰到好處、美味可口為止。一旦調配出美味的食物時，就不需再添加任何的東西，因為正確的佐料都已經加了。同樣的道理，確定我們的身行和言語沒有缺失，這樣就可以帶給我們「美味」和恰到好處的功德。

     - At first, we train the body and speech to be free of unwholesomeness. This is virtue. Some people think that to have virtue you must memorize Pali phrases and chant all day and night, but really all you have to do is make your body and speech blameless, and that's virtue. It's not so difficult to understand. It's just like cooking food - put in a little bit of this and a little bit of that until it's just right and it's delicious. And once it's delicious, you don't have to put anything else into it. The right ingredients have already been added. In the same way, taking care that our actions and speech are proper will give us delicious virtue, virtue that is just right.

瘋子 Crazy Man
++++++++++++++

.. list-table:: 瘋子 Crazy Man [9]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【瘋子】

     - Crazy Man

   * - 假設一日清晨，你正走在路上要去工作，有個人無禮地向你叫喊辱罵，霎時，你一聽到這辱罵聲，正常的心便立刻轉變了，你覺得很不舒服，覺得很憤怒和受辱，所以你想要報復。

     - Suppose one morning, you're walking to work and a man starts yelling insults at you. As soon as you hear his insults, your mind gets agitated. You don't feel so good, you feel angry and hurt, and you want to get even!

   * - 幾天以後，另一個人來你家拜訪，並且告訴你：「嘿，那幾天辱罵你的那個人，他瘋了！而且已經好幾年了！他都是這樣辱罵每個人，但是沒有人會去在意他說的話。」當你聽到這兒，霎時，自在了起來。那以往積鬱在你身上數日的憤怒和不快，完全地消失了，為什麼呢？因為現在你已知道事情的真相。以前你還不知道時，認為那個人是正常的，所以你會憎恨他，同時也導致你痛苦。一旦真相大白，事過境遷：「噢，他是個瘋子！事情原來如此。」

     - A few days later, another man comes to your house and tells you, "Hey, that man who abused you the other day, he’s crazy! Has been for years! He abuses everybody like that. Nobody takes notice of anything that he says." As soon as you hear this, you are suddenly relieved. That anger and hurt that you've pent up within you all these days melt away completely. Why? Because now you know the truth. Before, you didn't. You thought that man was normal, so you were angry at him and that caused you to suffer. As soon as you found out the truth, however, everything changed: "Oh, he's mad! That explains everything!"

   * - 當你瞭解到這點時，你覺得很舒服，因為你已親身體驗。瞭解了以後，你就能放下。假如你不明白真相，就會去執著。當你認為那位辱罵你的人是正常時，你可能會殺了他，但當你發現事情的真相——他精神失常，你便覺得舒服多了。這就是瞭解真理。

     - When you understand the truth, you feel fine because you know for yourself. Understanding, you can then let go. If you don't know the truth, you cling right there. When you thought that the man who abused you was normal, for example, you could have killed him. But when you found out the truth, that he was mad, you felt much better. This is knowledge of the truth.

   * - 一個見法的人也有類似的經驗。貪、嗔、痴的消失，是以同樣的方式消失的。當我們不了知這三毒時，我們會認為：「我能夠怎樣呢？我的貪和嗔是如此熾盛。」這並不是清明的認知，跟以為那瘋子是神智健全其實是一樣。只有當我們最後知道他精神失常時，我們的焦慮才得以釋懷。沒有任何人能告知你這些，唯有當心親自體認時，它才能絕滅和捨棄執著。

     - Someone who sees the Dhamma has a similar experience. When attachment, aversion and delusion disappear, they disappear in the same way. As long as we don't know these things, we think, "What can I do? I have so much greed and aversion." This is not clear knowledge. It's just the same as when we thought the madman was sane. Until we learned that he was really otherwise, we weren't able to let go of our hurt and anger. Only when the mind sees for itself, can it uproot and relinquish attachment.

   * - 【一杯水】

     - Cup of Water

   * - 來拜訪我的人中，有很多在社會上已有著高等的地位，他們當中有富商、大學畢業的、教師與政府官員。他們內心充滿對事物的種種看法。他們太聰明了，以致聽不進別人的話。這就像一杯水。如果一個杯子裡充滿了骯髒不新鮮的水，它並沒有什麼用處。只有當髒水倒盡，它才有可用之處。你們必須先除去你們充滿意見的心，然後才能領悟。我們的修行是超越聰明與愚痴的，如果你認為你很聰明、富有、重要、是佛學專家，這就掩蓋了「無我」的真諦了。你所見到的只是自己——我、我的。然而，佛教是入下「自我」的。那些太聰明的人將永遠學不到東西，他們首先必須除去他們的才智——空掉他們的「杯子」。

     - Many of those who came to see me have a high standing in the community. Among them are merchants, college graduates, teachers, and government officials. Their minds are filled with opinions about things. They are too clever to listen to others. It is like a cup of water. If a cup is filled with stale, dirty water, it is useless. Only after the old water has been thrown out can the cup become useful again. You must empty your minds of opinions, then you will see. Our practice goes beyond cleverness and stupidity. If you think that you are clever, wealthy, important, or an expert in Buddhism, you cover up the truth of non-self - I and mine. But Buddhism is letting go of self. Those who are too clever will never learn. They must first get rid of their cleverness, first empty their "cup".

築堤 Dam
++++++++

.. list-table:: 築堤 Dam [11]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【築堤】

     - Dam

   * - 在定力的訓練裡，是去修行以使心能安定和堅毅，這能帶來心的平靜。通常，我們這顆心是搖擺不定的，要控制它很困難。心隨著感官外馳散亂，就像水到處流竄一樣。雖說如此，人類卻懂得如何控制水，而使它更益於人類。人類很聰明，他們知道如何築堤防水，興建大型水庫和渠道——這一切都只是為了治理水，使水能更充分地被運用而不致於到處亂竄，最後流到最低處，而浪費了水的功能。

     - The training in concentration is the practice to make the mind firm and steady. This brings about peacefulness of mind. Usually our minds are moving and restless, hard to control. The mind follows sense distractions wildly, just like water flowing this way and that. Men, though, know how to control water so that it is of greater use to mankind. Men are clever. They know how to dam water, make large reservoirs and canals - all of this merely to channel water and make it more usable, so that it doesn't run wild and eventually settle down into a few low spots, its usefulness wasted.

   * - 同樣的，這顆已經「築堤」、被控制、經常訓練的心，將會獲得難以計量的利益。佛陀自己教導說：「已被控制的心，會帶來真正的快樂，因此，為了最大的利益，你們得好好訓練你們的心！」相同地，我們週遭所看到的動物——大象、馬、水牛等等，在它們能被利用來工作之前，都必須先受過訓練，也唯有在訓練之後，它們的力量才能帶給我們利益。

     - So, too, the mind that is dammed and controlled, trained constantly, will be of immeasurable benefit. The Buddha himself taught, "The mind that has been controlled brings true happiness, so train your minds well for the highest benefits." Similarly, the animals we see around us - elephants, horses, buffalos, and so on - must be trained before they can be useful for work. Only after they have been trained is their strength of benefit to us.

   * - 同樣的道理，已「築堤」的心將帶來比一顆未經訓練的心還要多倍的福澤。佛陀和他的聖弟子們，和我們都一樣在同一個方法下起步——有一顆未經訓練的心。但是，看看他們後來是如何成為我們所尊敬的對象，並且看我們能從他們的教化中得到多少的利益。真的，看看從這些曾經體驗心的訓練而為了達到解脫自在的人們身上，到底帶來了什麼樣的利益給整個世界。在所有的職業中或任何的情形況下，一顆受過控制與訓練的心是套更好且能幫助我們的設備，訓練過的心可以保持我們的生活平衡，使工作更得心應手。並且要發展和培養理性，以便控制我們的行動。只要我們追隨這顆訓練得宜的心，最後，喜悅也會隨著增長起來。

     - In the same way, the mind that has been trained will bring many more blessings than an untrained mind. The Buddha and His Noble Disciples all started out in the same way as us - with untrained minds. But, afterwards, look how they became the subjects of reverence for us all. And see how much benefit we can gain from their teachings. Indeed see what benefits have come to the entire world from these men who had gone through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyond. The mind controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all professions, in all situations. The disciplined mind will keep our lives balanced, make work easier, and develop and nurture reason to govern our actions. In the end, our happiness will increase accordingly as we follow the proper mind training.

   * - 【深洞】

     - Deep Hole

   * - 大多數人想行善只是為了功德，但是他們卻不願捨棄惡行，這就叫做「洞太深了」。

     - Most people just want to perform good deeds to make merit, but they don't want to give up wrongdoing. It's just that "the hole is too deep."

   * - 假設有一個洞，洞下面有東西，現在，只要有人將他的手伸進洞裡卻摸不著底面的話，他就會說：「洞太深了。」如果有百或千個人將他們的手伸進洞裡，他們也同樣會說：「這個洞太深了。」可是，卻沒人會說是自己的手太短了！我們必須回到自己身上，退一步反觀自己，不要埋怨是洞太深，而應該回過頭來看看你自己的手臂。如果你可以看透這點，那麼，在你的性靈道上便能更上一層樓，進而尋找到快樂。

     - Suppose there was a hole and there was something at the bottom of it. Now anyone who put his hand into the hole and didn't reach the bottom would say the hole was too deep. If a hundred or a thousand people put their hands down the hole, they'd all say, "The hole is too deep!" No one would say that his arm was too short. We have to come back to ourselves. We have to take a step back and look at ourselves. Don't blame the hole for being too deep. Turn around and look at your own arm. If you can see this, then you will make progress on the spiritual path and will find happiness.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【髒衣服】

     - Dirty Clothes

   * - 當我們的身體是髒的，而且穿上髒的衣服時，我們的心也將感到不舒服和沮喪，這是很自然的事。如果我們保持身體潔淨，穿乾淨、整齊的衣服，便能使我們的心輕快高興起來。

       同樣地，不守戒律，我們的身行和言語也就不清淨，這就是造成心理的不快樂、苦惱而沉重的原因。如果我們遠離了正確的修行，這會障礙我們徹見存在我們心中的法的本質。健全的身行和言語在於一顆正確訓練的心。因為是心傳達命令給身和語，所以，我們必須由「訓練我們的心」來不斷修行。

     - It is only natural that when our body is dirty and we put on dirty clothes that our mind will not be light and cheerful but will feel uncomfortable and depressed. So, too, when morality is not practiced, our bodily actions and speech are dirty. This causes the mind to be unhappy, uncomfortable, and distressed. We become separated from right practice and this prevents us from penetrating into the essence of the Dhamma in our mind. Wholesome bodily actions and speech themselves depend on the mind properly trained, since mind orders body and speech. Therefore, we must continue to practice by training our minds.

     - Drinking Glass

   * - 我如何找到正見呢？我就簡單地以手中正握著的杯子回答你們。它對我們而言似乎是清潔實用的，可用來飲水，更可以長時間的保存。所謂的正見是要將它看做是破的玻璃，彷彿已經碎裂了。不久以後，它將破碎。如果你在使用它時，心存這種見解——它只是元素所組合而成的杯子的形狀，終歸破滅。那麼不論它發生什麼事，你都不會有任何煩惱。同樣的道理，身體就像這杯子，它也將破碎、死亡，你們必須瞭解這個道理。但是，瞭解這個道理並不表示你應該結束自己的生命，就像不應該因此去打碎這杯子或丟掉它一樣。杯子是個可以使用直到它自然破損的東西。同樣地，身體有如一輛車子，利用它直到它回歸自然。你們該做的是去瞭解一切事物的本然。這種正見可以使你們無繫縛地生存於整個變動的世界中。

     - How can you find right understanding? I can answer you simply by using this glass of water I am holding. It appears to us as clean and useful, something to drink from and keep for a long time. Right understanding is to see this as broken glass, as if it has already been shattered. Sooner or later, it will be shattered. If you keep this understanding while you are using it - that all it is is a combination of elements which come together in this form and then break apart - then no matter what happens to the glass, you will have no problem. The body is like the glass. It is also going to break apart and die. You have to understand that. Yet when you do, it doesn't mean you should go and kill yourself, just as you shouldn't take the glass and break it or throw it away. The glass is something to use until it falls apart in its own natural way. In the same way, the body is a vehicle to use until goes its own way. Your task is to see what the natural way of things is. This understanding can make you free in all the changing circumstances of the entire world.

   * - 【空】

     - Empty Space

   * - 人們響往涅槃，不過，一旦你告訴他們那兒空無一物時，心裡馬上起第二想。但那兒什麼也沒有，空無一物。看看這兒的屋頂和地板；屋頂代表「有」，而地板也代表「有」，你可以站在屋頂上，也可以站在地板上，但是，在屋頂和地板之間的空間卻無處可站。沒有「有」的地方，就是「空」的所在；直接地，涅槃即是「空」。人們一聽到這兒便退卻不想去了。他們怕會見不著自己的孩子和親戚。

     - People want to go to Nibbana but when you tell them that there is nothing there, they begin to have second thoughts. But there's nothing there, nothing at all! Look at the roof and floor here. Think of the roof as a "becoming" and the floor as a "becoming", too. You can stand on the roof and you can stand on the floor, but in the empty space between the roof and the floor there is no place to stand. Where there is no becoming, that's where there's emptiness, and to put it bluntly, we say that Nibbana is this emptiness. People hear this and they back up a bit. They don't want to go. They're afraid that they won't see their children or relatives.

   * - 這就是為什麼當我們祝福在家人的時候，會說：「祝你們長壽、美麗、健康、快樂。」他們就會很高興，可是，一旦你談起「放下」和「空」時，他們便不想聽了。但你是否見過一個外表美麗、體力充沛或非常或非常幸福的老人？沒有！然而我們卻說：「長壽、美麗、健康、快樂。」他們也非常歡喜。他們執著「有」，執著生死輪迴。他們歡喜站在屋頂和地板上面，很少有人敢「站」在中間的「空」間。

     - That's why whenever we bless the laity by wishing them long life, beauty, and strength, they become very happy. However, if we start talking about letting go and about emptiness they don't want to hear about it. But have you ever seen a very old person with a beautiful complexion, or a lot of strength, or a lot of happiness? No! But we wish them long life; beauty, happiness and strength, and they are all pleased. They're attached to becoming, to the cycle of birth and death. They prefer to stand on the roof or on the floor. Few are they who dare to stand in the empty space between.

   * - 如果你想尋找佛法，它不在森林裡、山裡或洞穴中，而是在心裡。法有它自己的語言，那就是「經驗的語言」。概念與經驗之間有極大的差異。就以一杯熱水裡，都會有相同的經驗——熱，我們可以用不同語言的文字來表達。同樣地，任何人只要深入地洞察內心，不論什麼文化、地域或語言也會有相同的經驗。如果在你們心中，賞到了真理的滋味、法的滋味，你們會像一個大家庭一樣，猶如父母、兄弟、姐妹，因為你們已賞到了與所有人都一致的「心的本質」。

     - If you want to find Dhamma, it has nothing to do with the forest with mountains or the caves. It's only in the heart, and has its own language of experience. There is a great difference between concepts and direct experience. With a glass of hot water, whoever puts his finger into it will have the same experience - hot - which can be expressed in as many different words as there are different languages. Similarly, whoever looks deeply into the heart will have the same experience, no matter what his nationality, culture, or language may be. If in your heart you come to that taste of truth, of Dhamma, then you become like one big family - like mother and father, sisters and brothers - because you've tasted that essence of the heart which is the same for all.

火 Fire

.. list-table:: 火 Fire [20]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【火】

     - Fire

   * - 世上沒有一朝可成之事，所以剛開始在我們的修行裡，是看不到什麼結果的。就像我常告訴你們的譬喻：一個人試圖磨擦兩根木棍取火，他告訴自己說：「他們說這裡有火。」於是便開始使勁地磨擦。他很性急，不斷地磨擦，就是沒什麼耐性，心想火，卻一直沒有火的影子。他有點灰心，所以就停下來休息一會兒，後來又再開始，但是到了那時候，熱度都已經冷卻，所以進展得很慢。他就是磨擦持續的時間不夠久，以致一再地磨擦又磨擦，直到疲倦了，就將整個工作停頓下來，再說，他不只是疲倦，同時也變得愈來愈灰心，最後完全放棄且很堅決地說：「這裡根本沒有火。」

     - Nothing happens immediately, so in the beginning we can't see any results from our practice. This is like the example that I have often given you of the man who tries to make fire by rubbing two sticks together. "They say there's fire here!" He says, looking at his sticks. He then begins rubbing energetically. He rubs on and on, but soon becomes impatient. He wants to have that fire, but the fire just won't come, so he gets discouraged and stops to rest for while. When he starts again the initial heat that he had worked up has already been lost so the going is slow. He just doesn't keep at long enough. He rubs and rubs until he is tired and stops altogether. Not only is he tired, but he becomes more and more discouraged. "There is no fire here!" He finally decides and gives up completely.

   * - 事實上，他一直在做，但是卻沒有足夠的熱度可以引火，火一直潛在那兒，只是他沒有持續到最後。除非我們能達到平靜，否則心將依舊如前。因此我們偉大的導師說：「只要繼續做，繼續修行。」我們可能會認為：「如果我仍然不懂，我該怎麼辦才好？」但是，除非我們如法修持，否則智慧是不會現前的，所以我們說要持續地修行。只要不停地修行，我們就會開始思索自己的所作所為和修行。

     - Actually he was doing the work, but there wasn't enough heat to start the fire. The fire was there all the time, but he didn't carry on to the end. Likewise with the mind. Until we are able to reach peace, the mind will continue in its confusion. For this reason the teacher says, "Just keep on doing it. Keep on with the practice!" Maybe we think, "If I don't yet understand, how can I do it?" Until we're able to practice properly, wisdom won't arise. So we say just keep on with it.

   * - 我們不想要慾望，但是，如果沒有慾望，為何修行呢？我們要有修行的慾望。「想要」與「不想要」，兩者皆是雜染、煩惱、無明和愚痴。佛陀也有慾望。慾望一直存在著，它只是心的一種現象。有智慧的人也有慾望，但是，沒有執著。我們的慾望，就好像在網中抓一條大魚一樣——我們需要等待，直到大魚筋疲力盡之後，便可以輕易的捕獲它。但我們得一直盯著它使它無法逃脫。

     - We don't want desire, but if there is no desire, why practice? We must have desire to practice. Buddha had desire too. It's there all the time, but it's only a condition of the mind. Those with wisdom, however, have desire but no attachment. Our desires are like catching a big fish in a net - we must wait until the fish loses strength and then we can catch it easily. But all the time we must keep on watching it so that it doesn't escape.

     - If you attach to the senses, you're the same as a fish caught on a hook. When the fisherman comes, you can struggle all you want, but you won't be able to get loose. Actually you're not caught like a fish, but more like a frog. A frog gulps down the whole hook right to its guts. A fish just gets it caught in its mouth.

   * - 【魚籠】

     - Fish Trap

   * - 如果你清楚地看到了事物的利害關係，就不須等到他人來告訴你。回想一下一位在他魚籠裡找到東西的漁夫的故事。他知道有東西在裡面，也聽到它在魚籠裡面拍動。他認為是一隻魚，於是便將手伸進魚籠裡，竟發現是另一類生物。他看不見所以無法確定到底是什麼。可能是修鰻，不過也有可能是條蛇。如果將它扔掉，他也許會後悔……，如果是條鰻，就可以成為晚餐的佳餚。從另外一方面來看，如果他持續不放，最後竟發覺是條蛇，它可能就會咬他，不過不敢確定。但是，他的慾望卻強烈到不肯放手，只因為那可能就是條鰻。在他抓出的那一刻，霎時見到是條蛇時，不論如何，都會毫不遲疑地馬上扔開它，而不須等到他人喊：「嘿，那是條蛇趕快扔了它！」親睹蛇時比聽人家的警告更清楚地告訴他應該怎麼做。為什麼呢？因為他認識危險——蛇會咬你，並且會導致你死亡。這還需要有人告訴他嗎？同樣的道理，如果我們修行直到我們見到事物的本來面目，我們就不會去干預對自己有害的事物了。

     - If you see clearly the harm in the benefit of something, you won't have to wait for others to tell you about it. Consider the story of the fisherman who finds something in his fish trap. He knows something is in it because he can hear it flopping about inside. Thinking it's a fish; he reaches his hand into the trap, only to grab hold of a different kind of animal. He can't see it, so he's not sure what it is. It could be an eel, but it could also be a snake. If he throws it away, he may regret it, for if it turns out to be in eel, he'll have lost something nice for dinner. On the other hand, if he keeps on holding onto it and it turns out to be a snake, it may bite him. He's just not sure. But his desire is so strong that he holds on, just in case it's an eel. The minute he brings it out and sees that it's a snake, however, he doesn't hesitate to fling it away from himself. He doesn't have to wait for someone to call out, "Hey, it's a snake! Let go!" The site of the snake tells him what to do more clearly than words could ever do. Why? Because he sees the danger - snakes can bite and make you very sick or kill you. Who has to tell him about that? In the same way, if we practice until we see things as they are, we won't meddle with things that are harmful.

漁夫 Fisherman

.. list-table:: 漁夫 Fisherman [24]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【漁夫】

     - Fisherman

   * - 我們的禪定(靜慮)的修行可以使我們開解。舉個例子來說吧：譬如有個正在收網的漁夫，網中有條大魚，你能推想他收網時的心情是如何嗎？如果他深怕大魚跑掉，就會迫不及待地硬扯那網子，在他覺察之前，魚兒已經因為他操之過急而讓它跑掉了。

     - Our practice of contemplation will lead us to understanding. Let us take the example of a fisherman pulling in his net with a big fish in it. How do you think he feels when pulling it in again? If he's afraid that the fish will escape, he'll rush and start to struggle with the net, grabbing and tugging at it. In this way, before he knows it, the big fish will have escaped. The fisherman mustn't try to hard.

   * - 古時候，他們會這樣教我們：你們應該慢慢地來，小小心心地收網，以免讓魚兒脫逃。我們修行也正是如此，慢慢地靠修持來摸索出自己的道路，小心地收網以免遺漏了。有時，我們會遇到不喜歡修行的時候，也許我們不想瞭解，也不想知道，但是我們卻要繼續修行下去，繼續為修行摸索下去，這就是修行。如果喜歡修行，就去修行；不喜歡修行，也一樣要修行，就是要持之以恆。

     - In the old days, they taught that we should do it gradually, carefully gathering it in without losing it. This is how it is in our practice. We gradually feel our way with it, carefully gathering it in without losing it. Sometimes it happens that we don't feel like practicing. Maybe we don't want to look, or maybe we don't want to know, but we keep on with it. We continue feeling for it. This is the practice. If we feel like doing it, we do it. If we don't feel like doing it, we do it just the same. We just keep on doing it.

   * - 我們若是精進修行，那麼，信心就會給我們的修行帶來力量。不過，在此階段，我們仍然沒有智慧，縱使我們非常精進，也無法從修行中得到多少益處。這種情況會持續一段很長的時間，因而使我們生起一種永遠無法尋到正道的感覺，也或許覺得自己達不到平靜，或覺得自己沒有具備足夠的條件來修行，乃至認為「道」是件不可能的事。於是我們便放棄了！

     - If we are enthusiastic about our practice, the power of our faith will give us the energy needed to practice, but we will still be without wisdom. Being energetic alone won't make us benefit much from our practice. On the contrary, after practicing energetically for long time, the feeling that we are not going to find the Way may arise. We may feel that we cannot find peace, or that we're not sufficiently equipped to do the practice. Or maybe we feel that this Way just isn't possible anymore. So we give up!

   * - 說到這點，我們必須非常、非常地小心，我們要以很大的耐心和毅力，猶如網起大魚一樣——逐漸與它探索出自己的方法，然後小心地把魚網收回，扯那網子才不會太困難，所以我們繼續不斷地收網。經過一段時間以後，魚兒累得不能再掙扎時，我們就能輕而易舉地捕獲它了。這些都是修行通常會發生的事，不過我們只須慢慢地修持和小心謹慎地將修行聚集在一起。我們就是用這種方式來禪修的。

     - At this point, we must be very, very careful. We must use patience and endurance. It's just like pulling in the big fish - we gradually feel our way with it, we carefully pull it in. The struggle won't be too difficult, so continue to pull it in without stopping. Eventually, after some time, the fish becomes tired and stops fighting and we're able to catch it easily. Usually this is how it happens. We practice gradually and carefully, gathering it together. It's in this manner that we do our contemplation.

   * - 【手電筒】

     - Flashlight

   * - 在佛教裡，我們不斷地聽到放下而不要去執著任何事物，這是什麼意思呢？意思是要我們取而不著。就拿這隻手電筒做比方吧！我們會想知道：「這是什麼？」所以我們將它拾起，才發現：「噢，原來是隻手電筒。」於是就會放下它。我們以這種方式來取。如果什麼都不取，我們能做什麼呢？行禪或其他的事都不能做了，所以首先我們必須要取。是的，是欲求沒錯，但未來它將導引你到達圓滿。

     - In Buddhism we are endlessly hearing about letting go and about not clinging to anything. What does this mean? It means to take hold of but not to cling. Take this flashlight, for example. We wonder: "What is this?" So we pick it up: "Oh, it's a flashlight." Then we put it down again. We take hold of things, even of wanting, in this way. If we didn't take hold of wanting, what could we do? We couldn't do walking meditation or anything else. It's wanting, yes, a defilement, that's true, but later on that leads to perfection. So we must take hold of things first.

   * - 到這裡來也是一樣。首先你必須想來這裡，如果你不想來，今天你們也不會在此地。我們是因慾望而有行動的，但當慾望升起時，不要去執著它，就好像我們不會去執著那隻手電筒一樣——「這是什麼？」我們撿起來，「噢，是隻手電筒！」於是就放下它。這就是「取而不著」的含義。知道了後，就放下，不要愚痴地執著事物，但要以智慧「取」，然後放下它們。善或惡，兩者皆要全盤放下。

     - It is like coming here. First you had to want to come here. If you didn't want to, you wouldn't be here today. We do things because of wanting, but when wanting arises, we don't cling to it, just like we don't cling to that flashlight - "What's this?" We pick it up. "Oh, it's a flashlight." We then put it down again. This is what "holding but not clinging" means. We know and then we let go. We don't foolishly cling to things, but we "hold" them with wisdom and then let them go. Good or bad, we let them all go.

   * - 【高速公路】

     - Freeway

   * - 錯誤的知見是認為我們就是「行」，我們是快樂和不快樂。像這樣的瞭解是對事物的真實本性仍未完全清楚的瞭解。所謂的真理是：我們無法強迫所有事物聽從我們的慾望，它們都必須遵循自然的法則。

     - Not having full, clear knowledge of the true nature of things, we will go on thinking that we are the sankharas or that we are happiness and unhappiness. The truth is that we can't force things to follow our desires. They follow the way of Nature.

   * - 這有一個簡單的譬喻：假設你坐在高速公路中央，有很多汽車和卡車急撞你而來，你不能生氣地對車子喊道：「不准行駛到這裡！不准行駛到這裡！」這是高速公路，你不能這樣告訴他們，所以你該怎麼辦呢？你必須下高速公路！高速公路是車子行駛的地方，假如你不准車子在那裡，你就會痛苦。

     - A simple comparison is this: Suppose you go and sit in the middle of a freeway with the cars and trucks speeding down toward you. You can't get angry at the cars, shouting, "Don't drive over here! Don't drive over here!" It's a freeway. You can't tell them that. So what can you do? You get off the road. The road is the place where cars run. If you don't want the cars to be there, you suffer.

   * - 「行」也是一樣的，我們說是它們擾亂我們，如同我們靜坐時聽到聲音一樣，我們認為：「噢！是那聲音在干擾我。」假如我們認為是聲音干擾了我們，我們將會因此而痛苦。如果我們再深入地觀察，我們會瞭解，原來是我們出去幹擾了那聲音。聲音其實只是聲音。假如能這樣理解，那麼聲音也只是聲音。我們可以讓它去！我們瞭解聲音是一回事兒，和我們並不相干。這是真知真理，兩邊你皆看透了，所以才得果樹平靜。假如你只看到一邊，痛苦！一旦看穿兩邊，便是遵循中道了。這是心的正確的修行，也就是我們所謂的「修正我們的知見」。

     - It's the same with sankharas. We say they disturb us, like when we sit in meditation and hear a sound. We think, "Oh, that sound's bothering me!" If we understand that the sound bothers us, then we suffer accordingly. If we investigate a little deeper, we will see that it's we who go out and disturb the sound. The sound is simply sound. If we understand it in this way, then there's nothing more to it. We leave the sound alone. We see that the sound is one thing and we are another. This is real knowledge of the truth. We see both sides, so we have peace. If we see only one side there is suffering. Once we see both sides, then we follow the Middle Way. This is the right practice of the mind. This is what we call straightening out our understanding.

   * - 同樣地，一切「行」的本質是無常和死滅的，但是我們卻要捉住它們，背負它們，貪著它們，我們希望它們是真實的，我們希望在不是真實的事物中發現真實！不管什麼時候，若有人有這樣的想法，並執著「行」就是他自己，他會痛若不堪，佛陀要我們好好思惟這個道理。

     - In the same way, impermanence and death are the nature of all sankharas, but we don't want it that way. We want the opposite to be true. We want to find truth within the things that aren't true. Whenever someone sees like this and clings to the sankharas as being himself, he suffers. The Buddha told us to contemplate this.

     - The more you neglect the practice, and the more you neglect going to the monastery to listen to the Teachings, the more your mind will sink down into a bog, like a frog going into a hole. Later when someone comes along with a hook, the frog's days are over. He doesn't have a chance. All he can do is stretch out his neck and be caught. So watch out you don't back yourself up into a hole. Someone may just come along with a hook and pull you up.

   * - 在家裡，你常被孩子、孫子以及財產煩擾著，這比一隻青蛙還糟！你仍不懂得該如何去捨離它們。一旦要面臨老、病、死的時候，你要怎麼辦呢？這便是那根來釣你的釣鉤，你能往哪裡跑呢？

     - At home, being pestered by your children and grandchildren, and possessions, you are even worse off than the frog! You don't know how to detach yourself from them.

   * - 當微風吹過一棵正開著花的果樹時，有些花朵會散落在地，有一些花苞則仍留滯在樹上，長成小小的青色果子；當風再一次吹來，一些青色果子也會隨之掉落，在它們掉落之前，有些已接近成熟，有些則已經熟透。

     - When a fruit tree is in bloom, a strong gust of wind will blow some of its blossoms to the ground. Those that don't fall will eventually grow into small green fruit. But then another gust comes and some of them will fall, too. As for the rest, they will grow to become fruit nearly ripe, or even fully ripe, before they fall.

   * - 人，就像在風中的花朵和果實，也在生命的不同階段中「墮落」。有的在胎中就夭折；有的僅在出世幾天後就死了；有的在世幾年還未成年便去世；有的男女英年早逝；而有的人卻壽終正寢。當我們想到人的時候，應該連帶想起風中的果實——兩者都是非常不穩定的。

     - And so it is with people. Like flowers and fruit in the wind, they, too, fall in different stages of life. Some people die while still in the womb, others within only a few days after birth. Some people live for a few years, then die, never having reached maturity. Some die in their youth. Still others reach a ripe old age before they die. When reflecting upon people, consider the nature of fruit in the wind - both are uncertain.

   * - 我們的心也一樣，當法塵生起，在心中糾纏和「吹」一陣子後，心於是「墮落」了——就跟風中的果實一樣。

     - Our minds are also uncertain. A mental impression arises, draws and blows at the mind, and then the mind falls - just like fruit.

   * - 佛陀瞭解除一切事物不穩定的性質，他觀察果實在風中的情形，以此反觀他的弟子——比丘及沙彌們，他發現：基本上，他們也是一樣不穩定！怎麼可能有例外呢？這就是一切事物的本然。

     - The Buddha understood this uncertain nature of things. He observed the phenomena of fruit in the wind and reflected upon the monks and novices who were his disciples. He found that they, too, were essentially of the same nature - uncertain! How could it be otherwise? This is just the way of all things.

     - If your mind becomes quiet and concentrated, it is an important tool to use. But if you're sitting just to get concentrated so you can feel happy and pleasant, they you're wasting your time. The practice is to sit and let your mind become still and concentrated, and then use that quiet concentration to examine the nature of the mind and body. If you make the mind simply quiet with no investigation, however, then for that time it's peaceful and there is no defilement, but that is like taking a stone and covering up a smelly garbage pit. When you take the stone away, it's still full of smelly garbage. You must use your concentration, not to attain temporary bliss, but to accurately examine the nature of the mind and body. This is what actually frees you.

   * - 【禮物】

     - Gift

   * - 我們應該觀察身體裡的身體。不管身體裡有什麼東西，去看看它吧！如果我們祗看外表，那是不清楚的。我們所看的頭髮、指甲等等，它們的漂亮迷惑了我們，所以佛陀教我們看看身體的內部——身體裡的身體。身體裡面有什麼東西？仔細地看清楚！我們會看見裡面有很多東西會使我們很驚訝，因為縱然這些東西在我們體內，我們卻從來沒有看過它們。無論走到哪裡，我們都帶著它們，可是卻不認識它們。

     - We should investigate the body within the body. Whatever's in the body, go ahead and look at it. If we just see the outside, it's not clear. We see hair, nails, and so on and they are just pretty things that entice us. So the Buddha taught us to look at the inside of the body, to see the body within the body. What is the body? Look closely and see! We will see even though it is within us, we've never seen it. Wherever we go we carry it with us, but we still don't know it at all.

   * - 就像我們造訪親友的家，他們送我們禮物，我們接受後，把它放入袋中，卻擱著沒去打開來看裡頭是什麼東西。最後，當我們打開它時卻發現裡頭全都毒蛇！

     - It's as if we go and visit some relatives at their house and they give us a gift. We take it and put it in our bag and then leave without opening it to see what is inside. When at last we open it we find it is full of poisonous snakes!

   * - 我們的身體也是如此。如果我們祗看身體的外表，就以為它很完美、很漂亮，我們忘了自己，忘了無常、苦、無我。如果我們觀察這身體的內在，真的很噁心，裡頭根本沒有一樣美麗的東西。如果我們如實觀照，不故意去美化它的話，我們將會發現那真是可悲和令人厭煩，接著就會生起厭離心。這種厭離的感覺並不是要我們仇視這個世間，而是我們的心逐漸清明，心能放下了。我們看清一切事物都是不實在、不可靠的。不管我們對它們懷有多大的希望，它們仍會無情地離去——無常的事物還是無常；不完美的事物還是不完美。

     - Our body is like that. If we just see the shell of it, we say it's fine and beautiful. We forget ourselves. We forget impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not-self. If we look within this body, it's really repulsive. There's nothing beautiful in it. If we look according to reality, without trying to sugar things over, we'll see that it's really sad and wearisome. Dispassion will then arise. This feeling of disinterest does not come from feeling an aversion toward the world. It's simply our mind clearing up, our mind letting go. We see all things as not being substantial or dependable. However we want them to be, they just go their own way, regardless. Things that are unstable are unstable. Things that are not beautiful are not beautiful.

   * - 所以佛陀說，當我們經驗到色、聲、香、味、觸、法時，應該要遠離它們。不管快樂或不快樂，其實都一樣，所以放下它們吧！

     - So the Buddha said that when we experience sights, sounds, tastes, smells, bodily feelings or mental states, we should let them go. Whether happiness or unhappiness, they're all the same. So let them go!

小草 Grass

   * - 【小草】

     - Grass

   * - 你必須沉思，其目的是為了尋求平靜。一般人通常所指的平靜只是心的平定，而非連雜染也平定下來。雜染只是暫時地被壓制著，如同小草被石頭壓住一樣。如果你把石頭移開，小草將在極短的時間裡再次茂盛起來。其實，小草並沒有死去，只是暫被壓迫著而已。

     - You must contemplate in order to find peace. What people usually mean whenever they say peace is only the calming down of the mind and not the calming down of the defilements. The defilements are simply being temporarily subdued, just like grass being covered by a stone. If you take the stone away, the grass will grow back again in a short time. The grass hadn't really died; it was just being suppressed.

   * - 禪坐中也是一樣。雖然心很平靜，但是，雜染並沒有完全靜下來。因此，「三摩地」(定)並不可靠，若要尋得真正的平靜，必定要增長你的智慧才行。「三摩地」是一種的平靜，可是它就像石頭壓住小草，不過只是暫時的平靜罷了。智慧的平靜是將大石放下就不去移動它。如此一來，小草永遠也不可能再重生。這就是真實的寧靜，它們皆來自於智慧。

     - It's the same when sitting in meditation. The mind is calm, but the defilements are not really calm. Therefore samadhi is not a sure thing. To find real peace you must develop wisdom. Samadhi is one kind of peace, like the stone covering the grass. This is only a temporary peace. The peace of wisdom is like putting the stone down and just leaving it there. In this way the grass can't possibly grow back again. This is real peace, the calming of the defilements, the sure peace that results from wisdom.

   * - 那些研究理論的人和禪修的人，彼此誤解。強調研究的人，通常會這樣說：「修禪定的僧人只憑靠自己的看法，他們的教導是沒有依據的。」

     - Those who study theory and those who practice meditation misunderstand each other. Usually those who emphasize study say things like, "Monks who only practice meditation just follow their own opinions, they have no basis in their teaching."

   * - 事實上，從某方面來說，學習與修行這兩種方式，其實是同一件事。我們把它想作是手心和手背，可能會比較容易瞭解。如果我們把手伸出來，手背好像不見了，其實它並沒有消失，只是藏在下面而已。當我們再把手翻過來時，會有相同的情形發生，手心哪裡都沒去，只是藏在下而罷了。

     - Actually, in one sense, these two ways of study and practice are exactly the same thing. We can understand this better if we consider the front and back of our hand. If we hold our hand out, it seems like the back of our hand has disappeared. Actually the back of our hand hasn't gone anywhere. It's merely hidden underneath.

   * - 談到修行時，這點我們必須牢牢記住，假使我們認為它「消失」，就會改變心意而去做研究，希望能在研究中得到結果。不過，無論你下多少功夫研究佛法，你將永遠無法瞭解佛法，因為依據真理，你並不真的瞭解它。假若我們懂得佛法的如實本性，就會開始放下。放下就是——除去執著，不再有執著，就算仍有，也會逐漸減少。研究與修行之間，就有這種差異。

     - We should keep this in mind when we consider practice. If we think that it has "disappeared," we'll go off to study, hoping to get results. But it doesn't matter how much we study the Dhamma, we'll never understand it if we don't know it in accordance with Truth. If we do understand the real nature of Dhamma, then we begin to let go. This is surrendering, removing attachment, not clinging anymore, or if there is still clinging, it diminishes as time goes by. So study and practice are really just two sides of the same hand.

   * - 有時，面對不同的你們，我在教導時可能會有不一致、甚至矛盾的地方，但我的教導方法其實很簡單。就好像我看到有人從他不熟悉，而我卻曾來回行走過許多次的路上走下來，我往上看到他快要掉入右邊的坑洞，於是我參了喊道：「往左！往左！」同樣地，當我看到有人將要掉入左邊的坑洞時，我會喊：「往右！往右！」導引的方法雖然不同，但我教他們走向同一條路上的方向前進。我教他們要放下二邊而回到能夠抵達真實佛法的中道。

     - At times it may seem to some of you that I contradict myself when I teach, but the way I teach is very simple. It is as if I see someone coming down a road he isn't familiar with but which I have traveled on many times before. I look up and see him about to fall into a hole on the right-hand side of the road, so I call out to him to go left. Likewise, if I see someone else about to fall into a hole on the left, I call out to him to go right. The instructions are different, but I teach them to travel in the same direction on the same road. I teach them to let go of both extremes and come back to the center where they will arrive at the true Dhamma.

     - All my disciples are like my children. I have only loving-kindness for them and care for their welfare. If I appear to make you suffer, it is for your own good. I know some of you are well educated and very knowledgeable. People with little education and world knowledge can practice easily. But people with a lot of knowledge are like someone who has a very large house to clean. They have a lot to do. But when the house has been cleaned, they will have a big, comfortable living space. In the meantime, be patient. Patience and endurance are essential to our practice.

     - Don't be like a housewife washing the dishes with a scowl on her face. She's so intent on cleaning the dishes that she doesn't realize her own mind is dirty! Have you ever seen this? She only sees the dirty dishes. She's looking too far away from herself, isn't she? Some of you have probably experienced this, I'd say. This is where you have to look. People concentrate on cleaning the dishes, but they let their minds go dirty. This is not good. They're forgetting themselves.

狼狗 Jackal

   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【狼狗】

     - Jackal

   * - 有一次，佛陀在他停留的森林中看見一隻狼狗跑出來，它站了一侍兒，然後跑進草叢，又跑了出來，隨後衝進一個樹洞裡，又再衝了出來。一下子跑進穴裡又再跑出來。站了一分鐘，又開始跑了起來，接著又躺、又跳，原來那隻狼狗生了疥癬。當它站著的時候，疥癬會侵入它的皮膚，所以痛得拚命跑。跑時仍覺得不舒服，所以停了下來。站著也不舒服，所以躺了下來，一會兒跳起來，衝進草叢裡，樹洞中，就是無法安定下來。

     - The Buddha and his disciples once saw a jackal run out of the forest they were staying in. It stood still for a while, then it ran into the underbrush, and then out again. Then it ran into a tree hollow, then out again. One minute it stood, the next it ran, then it lay down, then it jumped up. The jackal had the mange. When it stood, the mange would eat into its skin, so it would run. Running, it was still uncomfortable, so it would stop. Standing, it was still uncomfortable, so it would lie down. Then it would jump up again, running to the underbrush, the tree hollow, never staying still.

   * - 佛陀說：「比丘們，今天下午你們有沒有看見那隻狼狗？站著苦，跑也苦；坐下來苦，躺下來也苦；它怪是站著使它不舒服，又說坐不好，跑不好，躺也不好。它怪樹、樹叢、洞穴都不好。事實上問題跟這都無關，，而是在它身上的疥癬。」

     - The Buddha said, "Monks, did you see that jackal this afternoon? Standing, it suffered. Lying down, it suffered. It blamed standing for its discomfort. It blamed sitting. It blamed running and lying down. It blamed the tree, the underbrush, and the cave. In fact, the problem was with none of those things. The problem was with his mange."

   * - 我們就跟那隻狼狗一樣。我們的不快樂由於錯誤的知見。因為我們不自我約制感官，因此責怪外界帶給我們苦痛。無論我們住在泰國、美國或英國，我們都不滿足。為什麼呢？因為我們的知見還不正確，只是如此罷了！所以無論我們走到哪兒，都會不快樂。如同那隻狼狗，無論它走到哪裡，只要疥癬治好後，才會感到輕鬆愉快。因此，當我們除去我們的不正見時，不管走到哪兒，都會很快樂。

     - We are just the same as the jackal. Our discontent is due to wrong view. Because we don't exercise sense restraint, we blame our suffering on externals. Whether we live in Thailand, America or England, we aren't satisfied. Why not? Because we still have wrong view. Just that! So wherever we go, we aren't content. But just as that jackal would be content wherever it went as soon as its mange was cured, so would we be content wherever we went once we cured ourselves of wrong view.

     - A knife has a blade, a spine and a handle. Can you lift up only the blade? Can you lift up only the handle? The handle, the spine and the blade are all parts of the same knife. When you pick up the knife, all three parts come up at the same time.

   * - 同樣的道理，假如你拿起了善，惡也必然隨至。人們一味地尋求善，試圖拋棄惡，但是，他們卻沒有學習非善和非惡。如果你沒有學習非善和非惡，那麼，你將得不到真實的知見。如果只取善，惡一樣會跟著來；如果只取樂，苦同樣隨至。訓練你的心，直到它超越善、惡，而那就是修行完成的時候。

     - In the same way, if you pick up that which is good, the bad must follow. People search for goodness and try to throw away evil, but they don't study that which is neither good nor evil. If you don't study this, then you won't have real understanding. If you pick up goodness, badness follows. If you pick up happiness, suffering follows. Train the mind until it is above good and evil. That's when the practice is finished.

結 Knot

   * - 【結】

     - Knot

   * - 我們必須觀照快樂和不快樂都是不穩固而無常的，也必須瞭解所有的感覺都是不長久、不能執著的。我們這樣來瞭解事物，因為我們有智慧。我們應瞭解事物會如此都是順其本然的。

     - We contemplate happiness and unhappiness as uncertain and impermanent and understand that all the various feelings we experience are not lasting and not to be clung to. We see things in this way, because we have wisdom. We understand that things are impermanent according to their own nature.

   * - 假使我們有這種見解，就猶如手執繩結的一端，只要能把這一端向正確方向拉，結自然會鬆弛而解開來，於是就不會再那麼緊了。

     - If we have this kind of understanding, it's like taking hold of one strand of a rope that makes a knot and pulling it in the right direction. The knot will then loosen and begin to untangle. It'll no longer be so tight and tense.

   * - 這跟明白萬事萬物並不是一成不變的道理很相近。在這之前，我們認為一切事物都必須如何，就因為如此，繩結只有被愈拉愈緊。這種緊，便是痛苦。這樣的生活是非常緊張的，所以，我們要把結鬆掉一些，而且放輕鬆。為甚麼要放鬆呢？就是因為太緊了。如果我們不執著就可以放鬆了，它並不是一個永遠一成不變的狀態。

     - This is similar to understanding that things don't always have to be the way they've always been. Before, we felt that things had to be a certain way, and in so doing, we pulled the knot tighter and tighter. This tightness is suffering. Living that way is very tense. So we loosen the knot a little and relax. Why do we loosen it? Because it's tight! If we don't cling to it, then we can loosen it. It's not a condition that must always be that way.

   * - 我們以無常的教導為基礎，明白快樂與不快樂均非恆常，兩者都不能依靠，也絕無恆常的事物。有了這種認識，我們逐漸會不再信賴錯誤的知見，錯誤的知見就會相對地減少，這便是解結的含義，這樣做，結就會愈來愈松，執著也會隨之逐漸根除。

     - We use the teaching of impermanence as our basis. We see that both happiness and unhappiness are not permanent. We see them as not dependable. There's absolutely nothing that is permanent. With this kind of understanding, we gradually stop believing in the various moods and feelings that come up in our mind. Wrong understanding will decrease in the same degree that we stop believing in them. This is what is meant by undoing the knot. It continues to become looser. Attachment will be gradually uprooted.

     - Most of us just talk about practice without having really done it. This is like the man whose roof is leaking on one side so that he sleeps on the other side of the house. When the sunshine comes in on that side, he rolls over to the other side, all the time thinking, "When will I ever get a decent house like everyone else?" If the whole roof leaks, then he just gets up and leaves. This is not the way to do things, but that's how most people are.

   * - 心，猶如那樹葉，當它與法塵接觸時，便會隨著法塵的性質而「拍打舞動」起來。只要我們對佛法的瞭解越少，心越會不斷地追逐法塵。感到快樂時，就屈服於快樂；感到痛苦時，就屈服於痛苦，它總是在混亂之中。

     - The mind is the same. When it contacts a mental impression, it, too, flaps and flutters. According to the nature of that mental impression. And the less we know of Dhamma, the more the mind will continually pursue mental impressions. Feeling happy, it succumbs to happiness. Feeling suffering, it succumbs to suffering. It's in a constant flap.

   * - 如果我們砍下一塊木頭將它扔進河水裡，木頭便會漂向下流。假使這塊木頭不腐朽或停滯在一旁的河岸，終究會漂流入大海。同樣的道理，修習中道的心，如果不去執於感官耽溺或自我苦行的任何一端，必然會達到真正的寧靜。

     - If we cut a log of wood and throw it into a river, it floats downstream. If that log doesn't rot or get stuck on one of the banks of the river, it will finally reach the ocean. Likewise, the mind that practices the Middle Way and doesn't attach to either extreme of sensual indulgence or self-mortification will inevitably attain true peace.

   * - 在我們譬喻裡的那塊木頭，代表心，河岸的一邊代表愛，另一邊代表恨；或說岸的一邊是快樂，另一邊是不快樂。所謂遵循中道，是瞭解愛、恨和快樂、不快樂的真實面目——祇是感覺而已。一旦獲得這樣的領悟，心就不會那麼輕易地漂向它們而被束縛。這就是領悟的心的修行，不去滋養任何感覺的升起，乃至不會去執著它們。接著，心便自由無礙地漂向下游，最後流入「涅槃海」。

     - The log in our analogy represents the mind. The banks of the river represent, on one side, love, and on the other, hate. Or you can say that one bank is happiness and the other unhappiness. To follow the Middle Way is to see love, hate, happiness and unhappiness for what they really are - only feelings. Once this understanding has been achieved, the mind will not easily drift toward them and get caught. It is the practice of the understanding mind not to nurture any feelings that rise or to cling to them. The mind then freely flows down the river unhampered and eventually flows into the "ocean" of Nibbana.

     - If you don't bother to train your heart, then it remains wild, following the ways of nature. It's possible to train that nature, however, so that it can be used to advantage. This is comparable to trees. If we just left trees in their natural state, then we would never be able to build houses with them. We couldn't make planks or anything of use to build houses with. However, if a carpenter came along wanting to build a house, he would go looking for trees in their natural state. He would take raw material and use it to advantage. In a short time he could have a house built.

   * - 禪坐與心的增長也是如此。你必須對這顆未經訓練的心——如同你會去森林裡取自然狀態下的樹，加以訓練，這樣，心才會對自己更細膩、更清明，而且更為敏銳。

     - We say that morality, concentration and wisdom are the path on which all the Noble Ones have walked to enlightenment. They are all one. Morality is concentration, concentration is morality. Concentration is wisdom, wisdom is concentration. It's like a mango. When it's a flower, we call it a flower. When it becomes a fruit, we call it a mango. When it ripens, we call it a ripe mango. It's a lone mango, but it continually changes. The big mango grows from the small mango, the small mango grows from the small mango, and the small mango becomes a big one. You can call them different fruit or all one. Morality, concentration and wisdom are related like this. In the end it's the entire path that leads to enlightenment.

   * - 我們必須瞭解：芒果，它最初出現時是一朵花，然後逐漸長成熟，不管別人怎麼叫它，都沒關係。一旦芒果出生，便步向老熟，然後它會往哪裡去呢？我們要好好思惟這個問題。

     - The mango, from the moment it first appears as a flower, simply grows to ripeness. We should see it like this. Whatever others call it, it doesn't matter. Once it's born, it grows to old age and then where? We should contemplate this.

   * - 有些人不想要老，當他們老了之後，顯得很不甘心。像這些人實在不應吃已熟的芒果！我們為什麼希望芒果成熟呢？如果時候到了它們還未成熟，我們就會以人工的方法促使它成熟，不是嗎？但是當我們年老時，我們卻滿懷不願。有些人為此掉淚，他們懼怕老死。若是這樣的話，那麼他們最好祇吃花，而不應吃成熟的芒果。如果我們能明白這個道理，我們就能見到佛法。一切都能清楚明白之後，我們就平靜了。

     - Some people don't want to be old. When they get old, they become regretful. These people shouldn't eat ripe mangoes. Why do we want the mangoes to be ripe? If they're not ripe in time, we ripen them artificially, don't we? But when we become old we're filled with regret. Some people cry. They're afraid to get old and die. If it's like this, they shouldn't eat ripe mangoes. They'd better eat just the flowers! If we can see this then we can see the Dhamma. Everything clears up and we are at peace.

     - Don't be angry with those who don't practice. Don't speak against them. Just continually advise them. They will come to the Dhamma when their spiritual factors are developed. It's like selling medicines. We advertise our medicines and those with a headache or stomachache will come and take some. Those who don't want our medicines let them be. They're like fruit that are still green. We can't force them to be ripe and sweet — just let them be. Let them grow up, sweeten and ripen all by themselves. If we think like this, our minds will be at ease. So we don't need to force anybody. Simply advertise our medicines and leave it at that. When someone is ill, he'll come around and buy some.

     - Everything that you do you must do with clarity and awareness. When you see clearly, you'll no longer feel the need to force yourself to do and complete everything. Now you are burdened with difficulties because you miss the point: whatever you do, you should just do with your body and mind completely. This will bring you peace. If you think you have to do and complete everything, then whenever you leave something undone or incomplete, you'll feel discontented and never stop worrying about it. You want to complete everything, but it's really impossible to do so.

   * - 就拿時常來看我的那些生意人為例，他們說：「當我的債務通通還清，財產也理清時，我就來出家。」話雖這麼說，但他們何時才會結束而準備就緒？永無止期啊！他們用另一個借款來償還債務，還清了一個又借一個。每位生意人都會想，如果能讓他從債務中脫身，他就快樂了，然而還清債務是遙遙無期的。這就是世間愚弄我們的方法。我們就這樣反覆地周旋著，永遠不知道自己的可悲。

     - Take the case of the merchants who regularly come here to see me. They say, "Oh, when my debts are all paid and property in order, I'll come to get ordained." They talk like that, but will they ever finish and get it all in order? There's no end to it. They pay off their debts with another loan; they pay off that one, and do it again. A merchant thinks that when he gets rid of all of his debts, he will be happy, but there's no end to paying things off. That's the way worldliness fools us. We go around and around like that never realizing our predicament.

Maggot

.. list-table:: 蛆 Maggot [48]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【蛆】

     - Maggot

   * - 快樂不是憑靠和我們相處的人有多少，而是來自於「正見」。如果我們擁有正見，那麼無論我們行居何處，我們仍將是快樂的。

     - Contentment doesn't depend on how many people we are with. It comes only from right view. If we have right view, then wherever we stay, we are content.

   * - 但我們大部份的見解都不正確，就如同一隻住在糞堆裡的蛆。蛆住在骯髒的地方，吃的也是骯髒的，不過，這一切對蛆來說卻是無比舒適。假若你拿一枝筷子將牠從那堆糞便裡剔出來，它會奮力掙扎地爬回牠的家。

     - But most of us have wrong view. It's just like a maggot living in a pile of dung. It lives in filth, its food is filth, but it suits the maggot. If you take a stick and dislodge it from its lump of dung, it'll squirm and wiggle back to its home.

   * - 我們也不例外。老師教導我們要有正見，但我們覺得很不舒服，一下子就溜回我們的惡習與妄見，因為只有這樣做，我們才會覺得舒服。如果我們沒有見到一切妄見的有害後果，那麼，我們便無法遠離他們。修行是件不容易的事，因此，你必須聽從你的老師，這就是修行了。

     - We are the same. The teacher advises us to see rightly but we squirm about and are uncomfortable. We quickly run back to our old habits and views because that's where we feel at home. If we don't see the harmful consequences of all our wrong views, then we can't leave them. The practice is difficult, so we should listen to the teacher.

油和水 Oil and Water
++++++++++++++++++++

.. list-table:: 油和水 Oil and Water [49]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【油和水】

     - Oil and Water

   * - 油和水是不同的，同樣的道理，一位有智慧的人和一位愚痴無明的人是不相同的。佛陀生活在色、聲、香、味、觸、法的世界裡，但因為他是一位阿羅漢，所以他能遺物而不逐物。自從他瞭解了心就是心，想就是想後，便漸漸地捨離而不執著它們。他沒有將它們混淆在一塊兒。

     - Oil and water are different in the same way that a wise man and an ignorant man are different. The Buddha lived with form, sound, odor, taste, touch and thought, but he was an arahant so he was able to turn away from them rather than toward them. He turned away and let go little by little, since he understood that the heart is just the heart and thought is just thought. He didn't confuse them and mix them together like an ignorant man does.

   * - 心只是心，想和感覺也只是想和感覺；讓事物就只是事物吧！讓色只是色，讓聲只是聲，讓想只是想，我們又何須費事地執著它們呢？如果我們以這種方式去思考和感覺，那麼，這就是出離和不執著了。我們的想和感覺將在一邊，而我們的心會在另外一邊，就好像油和水——它們同在一個瓶子裡，然而，卻是分開的。

     - The heart is just the heart. Thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelings. Let things be as they are. Let form be just form, let sound be just sound, let thought be just thought. Why should we bother to attach to them? If we feel and think in this way, then there is detachment and separateness. Our thoughts and feelings will be on one side and our heart will be on the other. Just like oil and water - they are in the same bottle but they are separate.

孤兒 Orphan
+++++++++++

.. list-table:: 孤兒 Orphan [50]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【孤兒】

     - Orphan

   * - 最後，人們會變得神經質。為什麼呢？因為他們不瞭解這個道理！他們只是隨著情緒起伏不定，而不知如何去照顧自己的心。當心沒人關照時，就像一個沒有父母照料的小孩。孤兒是無所依靠的，而無依無靠的孩子是非常不安全的。

     - In the end, people become neurotic. Why? Because they don't know. They just follow their moods and don't know how to look after their own minds. When the mind has no one to look after it, it's like a child without a mother or a father. An orphan has no refuge, and without a refuge, he is very insecure.

   * - 同樣的，如果這顆心沒有受到照顧，如果沒有用正見來訓練或培育品格，就相當麻煩了！

     - Likewise, if the mind is not looked after, if there is no training or maturation of character with right understanding, it's really troublesome.

牛車 Ox Cart
++++++++++++

.. list-table:: 牛車 Ox Cart [51]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【牛車】

     - Ox Cart

   * - 假設我們有一輛牛車和一隻牛來拉它，車的輪子並不是長的，但輪跡卻是長的。只要這隻牛拉動車子，輪跡就會隨著車輪的拉動而延伸；輪子是圓的，輪跡卻是長的，若光看靜止的牛車，是看不到車輪有任何長度的，不過，一旦牛開始拉動車子，我們就可以看到輪跡也在我們後面一直伸長，只要牛不停歇地拉，車輪便會不停地轉動。然而，終有那麼一天的來臨——當牛疲睏脫牛軛時，牠走開了，只留下牛車在那兒，輪子也不再轉動了！時間一到，這牛車自然會分崩離析，構成車子的所有部份也將歸回四種元素：地、水、火、風。

     - Suppose we had a cart, and an ox to pull it. The wheels of the cart aren't long, but the tracks are. As long as the ox pulls the cart, the tracks will follow. The wheels are round, yet the tracks are long. Just looking at the stationary cart, one couldn't see anything long about the wheels, but once the ox starts pulling the cart, we see the tracks stretching out behind. As long as the ox keeps pulling, the wheels keep turning. But there comes a day when the ox gets tired and throws off its yoke. The ox walks off and the cart is left there. The wheels no longer turn. In time the cart falls apart. Its constituent parts go back into the four elements of earth, water, wind and fire.

   * - 跟隨世間法的人們也是一樣！如果有人想在世間法裡尋找寧靜，他將無停歇地像車輪所輾出的輪跡一樣，繼續下去。如果我們不斷追隨世間法，我們就沒得停止、沒得歇息。只要我們很單純地停止追隨世間法，車輪便會停止不再轉動。不停地追隨世間法，輪跡就會繼續不斷延伸，製造惡業也是一樣。只要我們再次地重蹈覆轍，一切將永無止期。如果我們停止，一切也將停止。這就是佛法的修習。

     - People who follow the world are the same. If one were to look for peace within the world, one would go on and on without end, just like the wheels of a cart. As long as we follow the world, there is no stopping, no rest. If we simply stop following it, the wheels of the cart no longer turn. There is stopping right there. Following the world ceaselessly, the tracks go on. Creating bad kamma is like this. As long as we continue to follow the old ways, there is no stopping. If we stop, then there is stopping. This is the practice of Dhamma.

水池 Pool
+++++++++

.. list-table:: 水池 Pool [52]_
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 【水池】

     - Pool

   * - 保持正念而且讓事物順其自然，那麼，你的心將在任何地方都安詳寧靜。好像森林中清澈水池般的平靜，所有美好罕見的動物都會來取水飲用，你將清楚地看見世界上一切事物的本然，你將見到許許多多美好、奇妙的事物的來去，但你仍卻是平靜的。這就是佛陀的喜悅。

     - Be mindful and let things take their natural course, then your mind will become quiet in any surroundings. It will become still like a clear forest pool and all kinds of wonderful and rare animals will come to drink from it. Then you will clearly see the nature of all things in the world. You will see many wonderful and strange things come and go. But you will be still. This is the happiness of the Buddha.
