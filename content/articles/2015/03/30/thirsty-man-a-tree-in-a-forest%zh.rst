   * - 【口渴的人】

     - Thirsty Man

   * - 有一個人走在路上，漫長的旅程使他口渴得想要喝水。他在路邊停下來求水喝，供水者對他說：「如果你喜歡的話，就喝吧！這水色、香、味俱佳，不過，如果你喝下它，就會生病，甚至病重而死或瀕臨死亡。」這位乾渴的人並沒有聽從勸告，他喝得像一個開過刀被禁水一段時間的病人一樣，為水苦苦地哀求著：「給我水，不管結果會如何痛苦，請讓我喝了再說吧！」於是他舀出一些水來喝，發現味道很不錯，便拚命的喝個夠，不過也病得幾乎要了命。這都緣於他強烈的慾望而無法聽從任何的忠告。

     - A man comes walking along a road. He is very thirsty from his journey and is craving for a drink of water. He stops at a place beside the road and asks for a drink. The owner of the water says, "You can drink this water if you like. The color is good, the smell is good, the taste is good, too, but if you drink it, you will become ill. It'll make you sick enough to die or nearly die." The thirsty man does not listen. He's as thirsty as a person after an operation who has been denied a good drink of water for a while. He's crying for water! So he dips out a bit of water and swallows it down, finding it very tasty. He drinks his fill and gets so sick that he almost dies. He didn't listen to the warning that was given to him because of his overpowering desire.

   * - 這就是為什麼人會被感官快樂所繫縛一樣。佛陀說它們都是毒，但因為他太「渴」了，所以聽不進去。他啜飲色、聲、香、味、觸、法，更何況它們都非常甘美，所以他喝個不停，結果很快地喝上癮了，一直到死為止。

     - This is how it is for a person caught in the pleasures of the senses. The Buddha taught that they are poisonous but he is thirsty and so he doesn't listen. He drinks in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations and mind-objects and they are all delicious. So he drinks without stopping, and there he remains stuck fast until the day he dies.
