   * - 【水流】

     - River Flow

   * - 肉身的老化和病痛並沒有錯，它只是順著它的本性。因此，導致我們受苦的不是身體，而是自己錯誤的知見。當我們誤解時，一定會煩惱不已。

     - There's nothing wrong with the way the body grows old and gets sick. It just follows its nature. So it's not the body that causes us suffering, but our own wrong thinking. When we see the right wrongly, there's bound to be confusion.

   * - 如同河裡的水，它很自然地會往下流，這是水的本性。如果我們站在河邊看著水急速流下，卻異想天開地想讓它逆流而上，我們會因此而痛苦。我們會因為我們錯誤的思想和想「逆水而上」而受苦。如果我們有正確知見，就會知道水必定是往下流的，除非我們覺悟和接受這事實，否則心將永遠動盪不安，永遠找不到平靜的心。

     - It's like the water of a river. It naturally flows downhill. It never flows uphill. That's its nature. If we were to go and stand on the bank of a river, and seeing the water flowing swiftly down its course, foolishly want it to flow back uphill, we would suffer. We would suffer because of our wrong view, our thinking "against the stream." If we had right view, we would see that the water must flow downhill. Until we realize and accept this fact, we will always be agitated and never find peace of mind.

   * - 水必然往下流的道理，就如同我們身體的現象，它一度年輕，然後趨向老化，最後死亡。不要期望有其他奇蹟出現，這不是我們所能挽救的。不要異想天開地想讓水逆流而上。

     - Our body is like the river that must flow downhill. It passes through youth, old age and finally dies. Don't let us go wishing it were otherwise. It's not something we have the power to remedy. Don't go against the stream!
